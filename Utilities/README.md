HSDPython SDK has been expanded and released as a separate software product. You can download 
it from [here](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stdatalog-pysdk). 

**[STDATALOG_PYSDK](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stdatalog-pysdk)** is a data-centric 
design and user-friendly Python SDK that can run with hardware boards that supply real-time data 
streams, empowering users with full control of the data acquisition process. It extends and 
substitutes the HSDPython SDK previously available inside the Utilities folder.
